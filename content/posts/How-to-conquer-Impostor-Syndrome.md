Whether we want to admit it or not, most of us have experienced feelings of being an imposter at work. Some days it’s niggling self-doubt or perhaps it’s a feeling that you’re a fraud and that you somehow don’t deserve your current job role. This feeling, which affects [up to 70% of us](https://www.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJBS/article/view/521), is known at Impostor Syndrome.

First coined by psychologists [Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes](https://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf) in 1978, they described it as the internal experience of “feeling incompetent and of having deceived others about one’s abilities” or feeling as if your accomplishments came about as a result of luck rather than genuine ability. They said the condition was associated with such characteristics as introversion, trait anxiety, a need to look smart to others, while also having a propensity for feeling ashamed.

#### My experience of Impostor Syndrome

For me, Impostor Syndrome first hit when I moved from journalism into the world of technical writing and software engineering where everything from everyday processes to terminology were completely alien to me. I had to teach myself the basics of code and computer science, how to work in an Agile environment and how to use the various tools to do my job. It felt like I was continually treading water, trying not to drown before I was found out.

Even after finding my feet in the tech world, Impostor Syndrome struck again when I moved to a startup where everyone was issued with MacBooks (I was more comfortable with PCs), the software was installed using Unix command line (I had a basic understanding of DOS commands) and the product ran on virtual machines (virtual what?). That’s not to mention the raft of new technologies, languages and tools I had to learn in order to do my job.

When I was fortunate enough to land a contract role at one of the top five tech companies earlier this year, Impostor Syndrome and self-doubt still crept in when I was faced with an enormous amount of new acronyms and technologies to learn, and I started to compare myself with my colleagues, who are mostly superstar Oxbridge and Ivy League graduates, coding competition winners and PhD students. However, I’ve learned a number of useful things to help me cope with it.

#### Everyone was a beginner once

No one is born an expert. Everyone was once a beginner at each skill or knowledge area they are become an expert in. The reality is that most experts have tried and failed repeatedly to learn or master their skill before they became experts.

![“The difference between a master and a beginner is the master has failed more times than the beginner has tried” — Yoda.](/images/How-to-conquer-Impostor-Syndrome/1*jtg33Zlv_2PpQsVM7vJHRQ.jpeg)

I always assumed a former colleague who taught me Bash (basic scripting) was a veteran expert. It wasn’t until I left the company, he confided that he had taught himself Bash six months before he taught me. Not to detract from how talented he was but my perception of his expertise was an illusion I had created in my head. I just assumed he had always been an expert.

#### You know more than you think

I found this diagram really helpful before a conference talk I gave last year. I had started to question whether I really had anything unique to share with a room full of experts. In reality, there were probably some people who knew far less about my talk subject than I did, some who had a similar knowledge level and some who knew more.

We make this assumption that others around us know far more than we do when in reality, you know more about certain subjects than others, just as they might know more about subjects your not so familiar with.

#### Don’t compare yourself to others

One of the biggest misconceptions is that everyone else around you is an expert. It’s not healthy to compare yourself to other people in your team. Our greatest asset is that we are all individuals with unique skills and experiences to offer. You won’t find two people in any one team with exactly the same knowledge of something.

If you’re a writer in a tech company like me, you’ll find that while your programmer colleagues might be experts in compiling and debugging complex code, they might not be quite so confident about writing useful, accurately spelled documentation for end users. Play to your own strengths and remind yourself that they exist!

#### Recognise your talents

A large contributing factor of Impostor Syndrome is not being able to recognise our own talents and achievements that have got us to where we are now. As a result, there is a tendency to assume it was the result of luck or we somehow conned our way into our current job.

Try to remind yourself of all of your accomplishments, the things you have learnt and the skills you have picked up in order to get to your current position. Your achievements are the result of your own hard work, work ethic and ability. The more you remind yourself of them, the greater the chance you have of changing your impostor mindset and building greater self worth.

#### Share your experiences with others

Clance and Imes believe that one of the best ways to manage Impostor Syndrome was to speak to other people who are going through the same thing and to share your experiences.

They found that group meetings made a significant impact on coping with the condition as it made people aware they weren’t alone in feeling like imposters. Reframing your mindset and ideas about performance was another activity the researchers suggested. For example, instead of thinking “I will fail this exam”, they encourage you to think “I will do well in this exam.”

#### Even “successful” people feel like impostors

I think it’s also important to remind yourself that even famous and successful people suffer from Impostor Syndrome. Celebrities like actor Tom Hanks, actress Emma Watson and former first lady Michelle Obama (and successful lawyer in her own right) have all admitted to feeling like impostors. The best example I came across was an anecdote told by Neil Gaiman, the author of American Gods and Good omens, who [wrote](https://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/160603396711/hi-i-read-that-youve-dealt-with-with-impostor):

> “Some years ago, I was lucky enough invited to a gathering of great and good people: artists and scientists, writers and discoverers of things. And I felt that at any moment they would realise that I didn’t qualify to be there, among these people who had really done things.”

> “On my second or third night there, I was standing at the back of the hall, while a musical entertainment happened, and I started talking to a very nice, polite, elderly gentleman about several things, including our shared first name. And then he pointed to the hall of people, and said words to the effect of:

> “I just look at all these people, and I think, what the heck am I doing here? They’ve made amazing things. I just went where I was sent.”

> And I said, “Yes. But you *were* the first man on the moon. I think that counts for something.”

> And I felt a bit better. Because if Neil Armstrong felt like an imposter, maybe *everyone* did. Maybe there weren’t any grown-ups, only people who had worked hard and also got lucky and were slightly out of their depth, all of us doing the best job we could, which is all we can really hope for.”
