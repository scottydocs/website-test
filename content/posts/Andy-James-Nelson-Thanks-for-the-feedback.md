[Andy James Nelson](https://medium.com/u/596961c6df90) Thanks for the feedback! Yes, it’s definitely difficult to work in all of these things at scale (and I agree that localisation adds another layer of complication) but there’s certainly no harm in trying to follow some of the general principles.

In the examples I found, some of mistakes being made seemed fairly avoidable with a bit more care and attention… or could have been resolved by simply getting a technical writer or UX writer to review the merge request when the error message/log was written!
