Apologies for the clickbait-y headline but everything I’m about to tell you is 100% true. If you’re a laid off or burnout news reporter or a journalism graduate struggling to get your foot through the door, the answer to your problems could be becoming a **technical writer**.

This is the article I wish I’d found when I was an unhappy journalist in my twenties, struggling to pay for basic things like household bills and running a car. It didn’t take me long to realise local newspaper journalism was a sinking ship, I’m just lucky I found a life raft in the form of technical writing.

No doubt you will have already heard of “going over the dark side”, joining the world of PR and communications where you learn to master the dark arts of “spin” and deception. Well, I would compare technical writing to joining the light side and starting a rewarding, less stressful (although sometimes challenging) but mostly fun-filled\* journey to becoming a Jedi master.

*\*In my experience, it has meant working in open plan offices where nerf guns, free snacks, board games, table football and arcade machines come as standard.*

### What is a technical writer?

A technical writer, sometimes called a technical author in the UK or an information designer, essentially writes documentation to explain how technology works (this might be software, hardware or services).

The highest level description of technical writing would be to say we write instruction manuals but there is lot more to it than that. Apart from writing user guides, a role in a software engineering team also includes writing things like release notes (small descriptions of what is in your release), UI text (microcopy that appears in the product such as the text on buttons or error messages) and helping with text in the code itself (code comments, parameter names etc.)

The role doesn’t just involve writing either, you may also be expected to do things like web design (not essential), user research, video tutorials (and scripts for video tutorials), audience analysis and information gathering,

### Can you still be creative?

Slaughterhouse Five author [Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut "Kurt Vonnegut") famously described technical writers as ‘freaks’ in the world of writing. He said:

> **…trained to reveal almost nothing about themselves in their writing. This makes them freaks in the world of writers, since almost all of the other ink-stained wretches in that world reveal a lot about themselves to the reader.**

However, some notable people who were technical writers include: inventor and painter Leonardo Da Vinci, as well as authors Robert M. Pirsig ([*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)*),* Amy Tam *(*[*The Joy Luck Club*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_Luck_Club_%28novel%29)*)* and Thomas Pynchon *(*[*Gravity’s Rainbow)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity%27s_Rainbow)*.* So I think it’s worth noting that choosing this path doesn’t necessarily mean you lose all sense of creativity as a writer.

### Sounds interesting. Why journalists?

Journalists have the training and experience to thrive in this role. When I left journalism after six years, I was surprised by the amount of crossover there was between my old job and technical writing. Some of the similarities include:

**Interviewing, research and writing**: The core part of technical writing involves interviewing people or subject matter experts (SMEs), information gathering, research and learning complex subjects and then writing it down in clear and concise language.

**The Five Ws and H of journalism**: The golden rule of journalistic reporting is to answer the five Ws (and one H): Who, what, when, where, why and how. The same principles can be applied to technical writing:

*   Who am I writing for?
*   What does the thing do?
*   When would you need it?
*   Where can you use it?
*   Why should you use it?
*   How can you use it?

**Ability to learn things quickly**: Journalists can learn and explain complex subjects with an authoritative voice. The same is true of technical writing. Sometimes the concepts you need to learn can be very complicated but if you like a challenge, then technical writing might be right for you.

**Concise writing style:** Journalists are trained at condensing 1000+ word stories (sometimes press releases) into a 30–100 word snippets such as News in Briefs (NIBs) or slightly longer down page leads.

Technical writing is no different. For example, sometimes a developer will write an incredibly wordy and repetitive description of their new feature that you need to edit into a snappy one or two line release note (text sent out to customers when a new version of your product is released).

### What’s so good about technical writing?

For me personally, the move to technical writing has vastly increased not only my career prospects but my overall job satisfaction, happiness and also self-confidence. Some of the benefits of working in tech include:

*   **Increase in pay**. You can expect as significant pay rise as a technical writer (especially in big cities). You’re likely to make more than the average editor by the time you become a senior technical writer.
*   **Benefits**. Things like subsidised travel, private healthcare, stock options, bonuses, free food and drinks are fairly common in tech startups and larger tech companies.

<figcaption>Travel isn’t a common perk but so far work has taken me to San Francisco (twice), Portland and&nbsp;Prague.</figcaption>

*   **Environment**. Like any job, work can be stressful but working in tech is far more relaxed than working in media. Startups in particular will strive to make the office environment feel like a fun and welcoming space.
*   **Work hours**. Remote working and flexible work hours are pretty standard. If you want to work 10am until 7pm or 11am until 8pm, or work from home then you can.
*   **Well-being**. Employees overall health (mental and physical) and well-being is taken seriously in tech. My last two employers offer free or discounted massages, advice on things like seating ergonomics and raisable standing desks.
*   **Fun**. Maybe I’ve got lucky but I’ve found working in tech incredibly fun. Not just the work but you can expect things like table tennis, table football, nerf guns, board games, computer games, subsidised nights out, team dinners and lunches and activity days.

### How can you become technical writer?

If you’ve made it this far and you’re still interested, you can focus on several things:

*   **Build a portfolio**. Write user guides for your favourite product (software, service, app etc) and find open-source projects to contribute to.
*   **Practice active voice**. We use active voice rather than passive voice in technical writing so there is no ambiguity about who the subject is and who is performing the action in a sentence.
*   **Learn to code**. If you want to work in software, learning to code will help. Most documentation sites involve some form of web design so learning some HTML, Markdown and CSS will help you. However, learn an object-orientated programming language such as Python, Java or Go if you really want to stand out.

### Why am I sharing this?

For the longest time, discovering technical writing has felt a bit like a secret I didn’t want to share with other writers. Why would I want to create more competition for myself right?

The reality is there are a lot of technical writing jobs out there and not enough technical writers to fill them. We need more talented and hungry people in this industry to bring fresh perspectives and bring new ideas to the table. I also know how depressing it can be working in a dying industry, a company took a chance on me so I thought it was probably about time to pay it forward.

If you’re a journalist or former journalist, I could not recommend technical writing highly enough. You’ll be joining a small but growing number of talented former journalists who have made the jump already. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me directly. What have you got to lose?
