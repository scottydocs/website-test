My name is **James Scott** and I’m a contract technical writer based in London, UK. After graduating from the University of Leicester with a degree in English literature, I became a journalist and worked for newspapers in Kent for six years before moving into technical writing.

I have worked with engineering teams in FinTech, the hospitality sector, AIOps (Artifical Intelligence for IT operations) and Android development. Most of my recent work has predominantly involved developer and API documentation.

### Public speaking 

I have given talks at two of the largest technical writing conferences in Europe: 

**How to write great error messages** - Write the Docs, Prague (September 2019).
