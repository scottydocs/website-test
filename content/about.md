My name is **James Scott** and Iâ€™m a contract technical writer based in London, UK. After graduating from the University of Leicester with a degree in English literature, I became a journalist and worked for newspapers in Kent for six years before moving into technical writing.

I have worked with engineering teams in FinTech, the hospitality sector, AIOps (Artifical Intelligence for IT operations) and Android development. My recent work has predominantly involved internal developer documentation and API documentation.
